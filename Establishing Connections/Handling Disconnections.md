# **Handling Disconnections in Socket.io**

In real-time applications, handling client disconnections is essential for ensuring smooth user experiences and maintaining data consistency. Socket.io provides built-in ways to manage disconnections effectively.

### Key Concepts

1. **Automatic Reconnection**: By default, Socket.io tries to automatically reconnect a client if the connection drops unexpectedly (e.g., due to network issues).
2. **Disconnection Events**: You can listen for and handle client disconnections using events like `'disconnect'`.

### Steps to Handle Disconnections

#### 1. **Listening for the `disconnect` Event**:
   On the server, Socket.io emits a `'disconnect'` event when a client disconnects. You can use this to perform cleanup tasks or notify other users.

   ```javascript
   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
     console.log('A user connected:', socket.id);

     // Handle disconnection
     socket.on('disconnect', (reason) => {
       console.log(`User ${socket.id} disconnected due to: ${reason}`);
       // Perform any cleanup or update necessary state here
     });
   });
   ```

   - **`reason`**: The reason for disconnection, which could be:
     - `"ping timeout"`: When the server doesnâ€™t receive a ping from the client in a timely manner.
     - `"transport close"`: When the connection is closed.
     - `"client namespace disconnect"`: When the client disconnects intentionally.

#### 2. **Handling Custom Cleanup Logic**:
   After a client disconnects, you might want to:
   - **Notify Other Users**: Broadcast the disconnection to other clients if needed.
   - **Update User Lists**: Remove the disconnected user from online lists or active user states.

   ```javascript
   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
     socket.on('disconnect', () => {
       console.log(`User ${socket.id} has left.`);
       // Example: Broadcast to other users
       socket.broadcast.emit('userDisconnected', { userId: socket.id });
     });
   });
   ```

#### 3. **Handling Reconnection**:
   Socket.io clients attempt to reconnect automatically by default. You can configure reconnection settings or handle specific events for reconnections.

   ```javascript
   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
     socket.on('disconnect', (reason) => {
       if (reason === 'transport close') {
         console.log(`User ${socket.id} disconnected but might reconnect.`);
       }
     });
   });
   ```

#### 4. **Detecting Reconnection Attempts on the Client Side**:
   On the client, you can handle reconnection and disconnection events to notify the user or log these events for debugging.

   ```javascript
   const socket = io();

   // Listen for reconnection attempts
   socket.on('reconnect_attempt', (attemptNumber) => {
     console.log(`Reconnection attempt #${attemptNumber}`);
   });

   // Handle reconnection success
   socket.on('reconnect', () => {
     console.log('Reconnected to server');
   });

   // Handle disconnection
   socket.on('disconnect', (reason) => {
     console.log(`Disconnected: ${reason}`);
   });
   ```

   - **`reconnect_attempt`**: Fires each time the client tries to reconnect.
   - **`reconnect`**: Fires when the client successfully reconnects.
   - **`disconnect`**: Fires when the client is disconnected.

#### 5. **Configuring Reconnection Options**:
   You can configure reconnection behavior, such as the number of attempts or delay between attempts, to suit your application needs.

   ```javascript
   const socket = io({
     reconnection: true,             // Enable/disable automatic reconnection
     reconnectionAttempts: 5,         // Maximum attempts before giving up
     reconnectionDelay: 1000,         // Initial delay (1 second)
     reconnectionDelayMax: 5000,      // Maximum delay between attempts (5 seconds)
     timeout: 20000                   // Connection timeout (20 seconds)
   });
   ```

#### 6. **Graceful Disconnection (Optional)**:
   If your app requires clients to disconnect gracefully (e.g., closing a chat session), you can implement a custom event to signal intentional disconnection.

   ```javascript
   // Client-side
   socket.emit('leaveChat', { userId: socket.id });

   // Server-side
   socket.on('leaveChat', (data) => {
     console.log(`User ${data.userId} is leaving chat.`);
     socket.disconnect();
   });
   ```

### Summary

1. **Listen for `disconnect`**: Handle user disconnection events to update the server state and notify others.
2. **Broadcast Disconnection Info**: Notify other users about disconnected clients, if necessary.
3. **Configure Reconnection Options**: Adjust reconnection settings to balance between resilience and performance.
4. **Implement Custom Cleanup**: Perform any necessary cleanup upon user disconnection, such as updating user lists or saving session data.
5. **Handle Graceful Disconnections**: For specific applications, allow clients to disconnect with a custom event for better control. 

Handling disconnections effectively improves the user experience and ensures data consistency across client sessions.
