# Authentication and Authorization in Socket.io

When working with real-time applications, it’s important to ensure that only authorized users can connect and interact with the server. **Authentication** verifies the identity of a user, while **Authorization** checks if a user has permission to access certain resources or perform specific actions. In Socket.io, this can be handled through middleware, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), and custom events.

#### 1. **Authentication**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client, often using methods like username/password, tokens, or OAuth.

##### Steps for Authentication with Socket.io:
- **Client-Side**: The client sends an authentication token when attempting to connect to the server.
- **Server-Side**: The server checks the token to validate the client's identity.

##### a. **Using Tokens for Authentication**

One common approach for authenticating users is using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. The client sends the JWT token to the server when connecting to the WebSocket, and the server validates it before allowing access.

**Client-Side (Emitting Token on Connect)**

```javascript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

// Send the token to the server during the connection request
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
  auth: {
    token: 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' // Replace with a real token
  }
});
```

- `auth` object is a special option in the client to send authentication data along with the connection request.

**Server-Side (Validating Token on Connection)**

On the server-side, Socket.io provides an `auth` option in the `connection` event, where you can check the validity of the provided token.

```javascript
const io = require('socket.io')(3000);
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;  // Get token from the handshake

  if (!token) {
    return socket.disconnect();  // Disconnect the client if no token is provided
  }

  // Verify the token
  jwt.verify(token, 'your-secret-key', (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return socket.disconnect();  // Disconnect if token is invalid
    }

    // Token is valid, allow access
    socket.user = decoded; // Store user info in the socket
    console.log('User authenticated:', socket.user);
  });
});
```

Here:
- The `socket.handshake.auth.token` is where the server gets the token sent by the client.
- The `jwt.verify()` method is used to validate the JWT token using a secret key.

#### 2. **Authorization**
Once authenticated, the next step is to handle **authorization**—ensuring that a user has the appropriate permissions to access certain resources or perform specific actions.

Authorization can be implemented in several ways depending on the requirements, such as using roles or permissions stored on the server.

##### a. **Role-Based Authorization**

One way to implement authorization is by assigning roles to users (e.g., admin, user, guest) and allowing different levels of access based on these roles.

**Server-Side (Role-Based Authorization)**

```javascript
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Example: User has been authenticated and their data is in socket.user
  const userRole = socket.user.role;

  // Check if the user is allowed to emit a sensitive event
  socket.on('sensitiveEvent', (data) => {
    if (userRole !== 'admin') {
      return socket.emit('unauthorized', 'You do not have permission to perform this action');
    }

    // Handle the event if authorized
    console.log('Sensitive event data:', data);
  });
});
```

In this case, after authentication, the server checks the role of the user (`socket.user.role`) to determine if they can perform certain actions like emitting the `sensitiveEvent`. If the user doesn't have the required role, they are denied access.

##### b. **Custom Authorization Middleware**
Authorization checks can also be made using custom middleware in the server to check the user's permissions before allowing them to interact with certain namespaces or rooms.

**Server-Side (Custom Authorization Middleware)**

```javascript
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;

  if (!token) {
    return next(new Error('Authentication error'));
  }

  jwt.verify(token, 'your-secret-key', (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(new Error('Authentication error'));
    }

    // Attach user data to socket object
    socket.user = decoded;

    // Custom authorization check
    if (decoded.role !== 'admin') {
      return next(new Error('Permission denied'));
    }

    next();  // Proceed if authenticated and authorized
  });
});
```

Here, a **middleware** is used to check the token and the user's role before the socket connection is established. If the user is authenticated and authorized, the connection proceeds; otherwise, an error is thrown.

#### 3. **Secure Communications with Socket.io**
For added security, use **HTTPS** and **WSS (WebSockets Secure)** to encrypt the communication between the client and the server, preventing attackers from intercepting sensitive data like tokens.

- **Client-Side (WSS URL)**:
  ```javascript
  const socket = io('wss://your-secure-server.com');
  ```

- **Server-Side (HTTPS and WSS)**:
  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');
  const https = require('https');
  const io = require('socket.io');

  const server = https.createServer({
    key: fs.readFileSync('path-to-private-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('path-to-certificate.pem')
  });

  const socketIo = io(server);

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Secure server running on https://localhost:3000');
  });
  ```

By using **HTTPS** and **WSS**, the connection between the server and the client is encrypted, ensuring that authentication tokens and other sensitive data are transmitted securely.

#### 4. **Handling Authorization Failures**
It’s important to gracefully handle cases where authentication or authorization fails. When a client is denied access due to invalid authentication or insufficient authorization, you should send an appropriate response or disconnect them.

**Client-Side (Handling Authorization Errors)**

```javascript
socket.on('unauthorized', (message) => {
  console.log('Access Denied:', message);
  // Handle the unauthorized event (e.g., redirect the user)
});
```

**Server-Side (Sending Unauthorized Response)**

```javascript
socket.emit('unauthorized', 'You do not have permission to perform this action');
```

#### Summary of Authentication and Authorization Process in Socket.io:

1. **Authentication**: 
   - The client sends a token (e.g., JWT) to authenticate the user during the connection process.
   - The server verifies the token and ensures the client is authorized to connect.

2. **Authorization**:
   - Once authenticated, the server checks if the user has the right permissions (roles, privileges, etc.) to access specific resources or perform actions.
   - Authorization checks can be done using roles, custom middleware, or based on user data stored on the server.

3. **Security**:
   - Always use secure connections (HTTPS, WSS) to protect sensitive data like authentication tokens.
   - Handle failures gracefully by sending error messages or disconnecting unauthorized users.

By implementing both authentication and authorization, you can ensure that only authenticated users can connect to the server and that they are authorized to perform the actions they request.
