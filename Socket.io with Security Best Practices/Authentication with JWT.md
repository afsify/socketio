# Authentication with JWT (JSON Web Token) in Socket.io

Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a popular and secure method for handling user authentication in web applications. JWT allows you to verify the identity of users and maintain their session across multiple requests without the need for session storage on the server. In the context of **Socket.io**, JWT is commonly used to authenticate users when they connect to the server via WebSocket.

Below are the notes on implementing **JWT-based authentication in Socket.io**:

---

### 1. **What is JWT?**
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- JWTs consist of three parts:
  1. **Header**: Contains the algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., `HS256`).
  2. **Payload**: Contains the claims or data, which could be user-related information.
  3. **Signature**: A cryptographic signature created using the header, payload, and a secret key.

A typical JWT structure looks like this:  
`header.payload.signature`

---

### 2. **How JWT Works**
1. **User Authentication**: The user provides their credentials (username and password) to the server.
2. **Token Generation**: The server verifies the credentials and, if valid, generates a JWT.
3. **Token Sent to Client**: The server sends the JWT back to the client (usually in an HTTP response or as a cookie).
4. **Client Uses Token**: The client stores the token (e.g., in local storage or cookies) and includes it in subsequent requests or WebSocket connections.
5. **Server Verifies Token**: The server verifies the JWT for every incoming request or WebSocket connection to authenticate the user.

---

### 3. **JWT Authentication in Socket.io**
When using Socket.io, JWT authentication typically occurs during the connection phase, where the client sends the JWT token as part of the connection handshake. The server then verifies the token before establishing the WebSocket connection.

---

### 4. **Steps to Implement JWT Authentication in Socket.io**

#### a. **Setting Up Server-Side (Socket.io + JWT)**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - You'll need `jsonwebtoken` for handling the JWT creation and verification.
   - `socket.io` for managing WebSocket connections.

```bash
npm install socket.io jsonwebtoken
```

2. **Create Middleware for JWT Authentication**:
   You will write a custom middleware function to verify the JWT before allowing the WebSocket connection to proceed.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

// Secret key for JWT signing
const SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key';

// Middleware for JWT authentication
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.query.token;  // Token sent by the client in the handshake

  if (!token) {
    return next(new Error('Authentication error: Token missing'));
  }

  // Verify the JWT
  jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(new Error('Authentication error: Invalid token'));
    }

    // Attach the user data to the socket object for use in the events
    socket.user = decoded;  // `decoded` contains the payload of the token
    next();  // Proceed to the next middleware or event handler
  });
});
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The token is sent by the client during the WebSocket connection (via the handshake).
  - The middleware verifies the token using `jwt.verify()`. If the token is valid, the connection is allowed; otherwise, an error is returned.

#### b. **Handling Authentication on the Client-Side**

On the client-side, the token needs to be passed when connecting to the Socket.io server. This is usually done as part of the connection URL query string.

```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
  query: {
    token: 'your-jwt-token-here'
  }
});
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The client sends the JWT token in the query string of the WebSocket handshake.
  - The server will then extract and verify this token to authenticate the user.

#### c. **Generating JWT on User Login**

You need a mechanism to generate JWTs when a user logs in successfully. This typically happens during a standard REST API login flow.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const app = express();

const SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key';

// Sample login route
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  // Validate username and password (dummy validation here)
  if (username === 'user' && password === 'password') {
    const payload = { username: username };  // User information to be encoded in the JWT

    // Create JWT token
    const token = jwt.sign(payload, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });  // Token expires in 1 hour

    res.json({ token });  // Send token back to the client
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
});
```

- **Explanation**:
  - On successful login, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.
  - The client can then store the JWT and use it for future WebSocket connections.

### 5. **Error Handling in JWT Authentication**
When using JWT authentication, errors can arise during the verification process. These errors should be handled gracefully.

1. **Token Expiry**: JWT tokens can expire, which will cause the server to throw an error during verification. You can catch this error and send a message to the client, prompting them to re-authenticate.

```javascript
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.query.token;

  if (!token) {
    return next(new Error('Authentication error: Token missing'));
  }

  jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      if (err.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
        return next(new Error('Authentication error: Token expired'));
      }
      return next(new Error('Authentication error: Invalid token'));
    }

    socket.user = decoded;
    next();
  });
});
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - If the token has expired (`TokenExpiredError`), it is handled explicitly by sending a corresponding error message.

2. **Error in Token Verification**: If there is an issue verifying the token (e.g., if the secret key is incorrect), you should catch this error and reject the connection.

### 6. **JWT Token Expiry and Refresh**
JWT tokens are usually short-lived for security reasons (e.g., 1 hour). After the token expires, the client needs to refresh the token, typically using a **refresh token**.

- A **refresh token** can be stored securely and used to get a new JWT when the original JWT expires.
- On the client-side, after the JWT expires, you can send the refresh token to an endpoint on your server that issues a new JWT.

---

### 7. **Best Practices for JWT Authentication**

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to secure communication and prevent token theft via man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Secure Storage**: Store JWTs securely on the client-side (e.g., in `httpOnly` cookies or secure local storage).
- **Token Expiry**: Set an expiry for the JWT to reduce the risk of token misuse.
- **Use Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh tokens to allow users to obtain a new JWT after expiration without requiring them to log in again.
- **Limit Payload Data**: Avoid storing sensitive information in the JWT payload. Keep the payload minimal and non-sensitive.

---

### 8. **Summary**
- **JWT** provides a secure and compact way to authenticate users in real-time applications like Socket.io.
- The JWT is passed during the handshake phase of a WebSocket connection, and the server verifies it before establishing the connection.
- Server-side middleware (`io.use()`) handles JWT verification, while client-side sends the token during connection.
- Implement error handling to catch expired or invalid tokens and ensure a secure, seamless authentication process.
- Always follow best practices for storing and transmitting JWTs to ensure application security.
